# Still Figuring It Out

A personal dashboard for people in their 20s who are navigating uncertainty around career, identity, relationships, money, and health.

This project intentionally avoids productivity culture and traditional goal tracking. Instead, it treats ambiguity, hesitation, and reflection as valid states.

## Why This Exists
Most life dashboards assume clarity. This one assumes confusion.

## Core Principles
- No gamification or streaks
- No forced goals
- Reflection over optimization
- Private by default

## Status
🚧 Early development — MVP in progress

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase

## Roadmap
- Life Areas Dashboard
- Weekly Reflection Flow
- Confidence Tracking (without progress metrics)
- Optional anonymous insights
